# Agile Iteration Plan for Expense Tracker Application

## Overview

This document outlines the user stories and iteration plan for developing an expense tracker application using Agile methodology. The requirements have been prioritized based on user value and implementation dependencies.

## User Stories (Prioritized Requirements)

1. **R1 - Add Daily Expenses:**  
   As a user, I want to be able to enter my daily expenses so that I can keep track of my spending.

2. **R2 - View Entered Data:**  
   As a user, I want to view the list of my previously entered expenses so that I can review my past spending.

3. **R3 - View Statistics:**  
   As a user, I want to see statistics (e.g., weekly/monthly summaries, charts) so that I can analyze my spending patterns.

4. **R4 - Daily Reminder to Enter Expenses:**  
   As a user, I want to receive a daily reminder notification so that I donâ€™t forget to enter my expenses.

5. **R5 - Export Function:**  
   As a user, I want to be able to export my expense data (e.g., CSV, PDF) so that I can store or share it easily.

## Iteration Plan

### Iteration 1 (I1): Core Functionality
- **R1:** Implement the ability to add daily expenses with necessary fields such as amount, category, and description.
- **R2:** Enable users to view and manage the list of entered expenses in a user-friendly interface.

### Iteration 2 (I2): Analytics and Insights
- **R3:** Add statistical views such as graphs, summaries by category or time period, and spending trends to help users understand their expenses.

### Iteration 3 (I3): User Convenience Features
- **R4:** Implement a notification system to remind users daily to enter their expenses.
- **R5:** Add an export feature allowing users to download their data in formats like CSV or PDF.

## Notes
- Each iteration is expected to be delivered incrementally with user feedback gathered at the end of every iteration.
- Priority has been given to features that provide immediate utility and improve user engagement.
